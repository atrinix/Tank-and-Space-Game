# Tank-and-Space-Game

**Tank Game Objectives:**

The objective of the game is to try to kill the other tank before they can kill you. 

In this game, there are two players, meaning that two people can simultaneously play together on the same keyboard. The first player is the red tank, and the second player is the blue tank. Both tanks spawn on opposite sides of the map. You can see the map in the middle of the screen towards the bottom, where you can get a clear view where the other player is. You’ll have to destroy some boxes in your way first to get to the other player, but the grey boxes are unbreakable.

There are also powerups the players can collect, where you can gain either an extra life, more defense, or more speed. Use these powerups in the corner and center of the map to help aid you in taking down your opponent. 

Each tank both starts with 3 lives with 100 health. Each bullet deals 10 damage. Whoever reaches 0 lives first loses, while the other tank wins.
	
**Space Mail Game**

The player is on a spaceship on a mission to deliver mail to moons. In this game, you will see yourself start out on a moon. You will have to fly to other moons while avoiding the asteroids. However, the rocket doesn’t have very good control. So once your rocket launches off the moon, it’ll keep flying forward, and it’s up to you to steer it out of harm’s way while avoiding the asteroids in your path.

You’re also a space mailman in a hurry, so the longer you linger on moons while trying to aim for the next moon, the lower your score becomes. So be prompt to get the best paycheck possible!

There are three levels, each level scaling in difficulty, from the moons and asteroids moving faster increasing in size, to your own rocket moving faster, making it harder to dodge the obstacles
